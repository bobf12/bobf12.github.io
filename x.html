This information sheet explains why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Once you have read the information you are welcome to get in touch with the researchers if there is anything that is not clear, or if you would like more information (contact details below). You can take as much time as you like to think about taking part.   What is the purpose of the study? The aim of this study is to explore and understand personal experiences of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and views about helping others who may be experiencing suicidal feelings, including family and friends, as well as strangers and passers-by. This is an important aspect of understanding how best to support those who are feeling in crisis, and we hope that it will help to reduce and prevent suicide attempts.   As part of the research we would like to hear the stories and experiences of a range of people, including those who have experienced suicidal thoughts; those who intervened in some way, or considered intervening, when somebody around them was suicidal (for example by approaching them or calling for help); and those who have never knowingly been around other people who were suicidal, or experienced suicidal thoughts themselves.   What will happen if I take part? This study is being conducted online. If you do decide to take part, you will be asked some questions about your own experiences of suicidal thoughts and behaviour, as well as your experiences of, or thoughts about, intervening when somebody else is experiencing suicidal thoughts. Completing the questionnaire should take around 10-20 minutes, depending on the experiences you might be sharing.   Previous research suggests that most people have no difficulty answering these types of questions, and are pleased to be able to provide this information. However it is possible that some questions could be difficult or potentially upsetting for you, in which case we would not want you to answer them. Before deciding to take part in this study, please consider carefully whether you are likely to find anything distressing and let us know if this is the case. Given the sensitive nature of the study, we are only inviting people over the age of 16 years to participate, and would advise against taking part in the research if you are currently experiencing strong thoughts of suicide, or have attempted suicide in the past month.   Do I have to take part? No, you do not have to take part if you do not want to. If you decide to take part you may withdraw from the research at any point during the study. You can also ask us to delete all of your responses within two weeks of taking part in the study (before the data analysis starts). When completing the online survey, you will be given the option to create a unique number. Please contact us at the email address provided below, quoting this number, and we will remove your data. No explanation for your request will be necessary or required.      Will my answers be anonymous? Yes, all of your responses will be kept completely anonymous and confidential.   What will happen to the results of this research study? We will produce a summary of the results for the charity Samaritans, who commissioned this research on behalf of the rail industry. The results of this study may also be published in academic journals. You will not be personally identified or identifiable in any report or publication resulting from this study.   Who has reviewed this study? All research that involves human participants has to be reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee before it can begin. The Middlesex University Psychology Department Ethics Committee has approved this study.   Contacts for further information Thank you for taking the time to read this information. If you have any further questions about the study, please don’t hesitate to contact us via the email, phone or postal address shown below:   Dr Lisa Marzano Department of Psychology Middlesex University Town Hall The Burroughs, Hendon London, NW4 4BT Email: L.marzano@mdx.ac.uk Tel: 0208 411 6998     If you would like to download a copy of the information sheet, please click here.     FURTHER SUPPORT If you feel that you are in need of immediate support, please contact Samaritans on 116 123 or NHS Choices on 111 (both are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and free). Alternatively, please go to, or call, your nearest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you are feeling.   Samaritans is there to support anyone who needs someone to listen and is struggling to cope. You don’t have to be in severe distress or suicidal to contact Samaritans for support, or to visit a Samaritans’ branch in person.   For more information about helping people who may be suicidal see Samaritans&#39; tips on how to start a difficult conversation and on interrupting someone&#39;s suicidal thoughts using small talk.   Rethink Mental Illness also has advice on how to support someone who is having suicidal thoughts.       CONSENT   Would you like to take part in this study? ">QID146(Info): RESEARCH INFORMATION SHEET   Understanding How B ...
